# Cylestio Telemetry Server Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Cylestio's local telemetry server. The testing framework addresses the challenges unique to our system, including asynchronous event processing, complex event relationships, varied data extraction logic, and hierarchical relationships between events.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Validate specific functionality of models, processors, and utilities
- Ensure each model's `from_event` method works correctly
- Verify data extraction logic for each model
- Test relationship management functions

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interactions between multiple components
- Validate event processing pipelines from ingestion to storage
- Verify event relationship tracking (spans, sessions, traces)
- Ensure database schema integrity and constraints
- Test cross-component interactions

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Test the complete system from event ingestion to database query
- Use realistic event sequences, including out-of-order processing
- Validate the final database state after processing
- Test complex workflows involving multiple event types

### 4. Performance Tests
- Measure processing throughput
- Assess database query performance
- Monitor memory usage during processing
- Test scaling with large event volumes

## Test Scenarios by Component

### Framework Events
- Test extraction of all framework metadata fields
- Verify correct framework type detection
- Validate error handling for missing or malformed data

### LLM Interactions
- Test extraction of parameters across different vendors
- Verify token counting and cost estimation
- Test handling of structured content in requests/responses
- Validate relationship with other event types

### Security Alert Triggers
- Test correct association of alerts with events
- Verify trigger detection logic
- Test security content comparison functions
- Validate alert categorization

### Sessions
- Test session creation and management
- Verify timestamp handling
- Test session relationship with spans and events
- Validate session duration calculation

### Spans
- Test span creation and updating
- Verify parent-child relationships
- Test span completion detection
- Validate span duration calculation

### Tool Interactions
- Test tool event association
- Verify metadata extraction
- Test relationship with LLM interactions
- Validate tool result handling

## Cross-Component Test Cases
- Security alerts correctly associated with LLM interactions
- Tool execution and result events properly linked
- Sessions containing the correct spans and events
- Traces containing the correct spans and events
- Events processed out of chronological order
- Complex event chains spanning multiple components

## Test Implementation Strategy
1. Extend existing pytest fixtures for comprehensive test environment setup
2. Create test data generators for each event type
3. Implement parameterized tests for consistent validation across event types
4. Use test markers to organize tests by category and component
5. Implement test utility functions for common verification tasks
6. Create benchmark tests for performance measurements
7. Use CI/CD integration for automated test execution

## Test Coverage Goals
- 80% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for critical data extraction functions
- Complete test coverage for edge cases and error handling
- Performance benchmarks for all critical operations

## Test Documentation
- Document each test case with purpose and expected outcome
- Maintain traceability between requirements and tests
- Include example test data and expected results
- Document performance baseline expectations
