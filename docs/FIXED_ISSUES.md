# Fixed Issues

This document lists the issues that were identified and fixed in the Cylestio Local Server project.

## Import Path Issues

### 1. Incorrect Import in `src/processing/__init__.py`

**Problem**: The module was using a relative import path which caused import errors when running the server:

```python
# Incorrect
from processing.simple_processor import SimpleProcessor, ProcessingError
```

**Fix**: Changed to absolute import path:

```python
# Fixed
from src.processing.simple_processor import SimpleProcessor, ProcessingError
```

This fixed the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'processing'` error when starting the server.

## Dependencies

### 1. Pydantic v2 Compatibility

**Added Support**: The project was using Pydantic v2, but some code still used v1 patterns:

- Updated validators to use `field_validator` instead of `validator`
- Updated serialization methods to use `model_dump` instead of `dict`
- Added dependency on `pydantic-settings` for `BaseSettings`

### 2. Environment Variable Support

Added proper environment variable support through the `pydantic-settings` package, allowing configuration through `.env` files or environment variables.

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation structure:

- API reference for all endpoints
- Getting started guide
- Telemetry events guide
- Metrics guide
- Example code
- Best practices

## Other Improvements

- Added test files to verify API functionality
- Added error handling to example code
- Improved code organization

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks may require further attention:

1. Full compatibility with OpenTelemetry bridge
2. Integration with external visualization tools
3. Additional example client implementations (JavaScript, etc.)
4. Comprehensive end-to-end tests
5. Performance benchmarking

## Future Considerations

For future versions, consider:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Rate limiting improvements
3. Data retention policies
4. Additional export formats
5. Enhanced dashboard views
